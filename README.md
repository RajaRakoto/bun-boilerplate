- 📜 `start` - Run your application with bun.
- 📜 `start:smol` - Run your application with bun and a flag which configures the JavaScriptCore heap size to be smaller and grow slower.
- 📜 `start:bin` - Run your standalone binary app.

**Clean**

- 📜 `clean` - Remove coverage data, prod, build.

**Development**

- 📜 `dev` - Launch your application in development mode with bun.
- 📜 `dev:watch` - Interactive watch mode to automatically transpile source files with bun in development.
- 📜 `dev:hot` - Hot reloading of source files with bun in development.
- 📜 `dev:smol:watch` - Interactive watch mode to automatically transpile source files with bun in development, while using --smol flag.
- 📜 `dev:smol:hot` - Hot reloading source files with bun in development, while using --smol flag.

**Build**

- 📜 `build` - Transpile and bundle source files with bun.
- 📜 `build:watch` - Interactive watch mode to automatically transpile source files with bun.
- 📜 `build:bin` - bun's bundler implements a --compile flag for generating a standalone binary from a TypeScript or JavaScript file, use this in your production environment to ensure optimal execution of your app.

**Testing**

- 📜 `test` - Run bun test.
- 📜 `test:watch` - Interactive watch mode to automatically re-run tests with bun.

**Linting and Formatting**

- 📜 `biome:fix` - Runs a source code check and applies automatic fixes (linter & formatter) according to the defined rules.
- 📜 `biome:unsafe` - Works like `biome:fix`, but may apply more invasive or risky changes.

**Backup and Dependency Management**

- 📜 `backup` - Backup files with Grunt.
- 📜 `pkg-check` - Check useless dependencies with depcheck.
- 📜 `pkg-upgrade` - Upgrade outdated dependencies (interactive mode) with npm-check-updates.

### 📌 Build

When using the **build.js** file in this boilerplate, it's important to note the significance of the **target** option. By default, if the target option is not specified in the **build.js** file, it will be set to `browser`. However, for projects utilizing the `bun.js` runtime environment, it's imperative to explicitly set the target to `bun`. This guarantees compatibility with the `bun` shell environment and prevents unexpected behavior. Furthermore, it's noteworthy that the `target` supports three possible values: `browser`, `bun`, and `node`, providing flexibility in defining the build target according to specific project requirements.
